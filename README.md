This app allows you to simulate how any origami crease pattern will fold.  It may look a little different
from what you typically think of as "origami" - rather than folding paper in a set of sequential steps,
this simulation attempts to fold every crease simultaneously. It does this by iteratively solving for small displacements in the geometry of an initially flat sheet due to forces
exerted by creases.  This solver extends work from the following sources: <br/><br/>

All simulation methods were written from scratch and are executed in parallel in several GPU fragment shaders for fast performance.

<b>Instructions:</b><br/><br/>
<img style="width: 100%; max-width:600px" src="http://apps.amandaghassaei.com/OrigamiSimulator/assets/doc/demoui.gif" /><br/>
<ul>
    <li>Slide the <b>Fold Percent</b> slider to control the degree of folding of the pattern (100% is fully folded, 0% is unfolded,
        and -100% is fully folded with the opposite mountain/valley assignments).</li>
    <li>Drag to rotate the model, scroll to zoom.</li>
    <li>Import other patterns under the <b>Examples</b> menu.</li>
    <li>Upload your own crease patterns in SVG or <a href="https://github.com/edemaine/fold" target="_blank">FOLD</a> formats, following the instructions under <b>File > File Import Tips</b>.</li>
    <li>Export FOLD files or 3D models ( STL or OBJ ) of the folded state of your design ( <b>File > Save Simulation as...</b> ).</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
    <li>Visualize the internal strain of the origami as it folds using the <b>Strain Visualization</b> in the left menu.</li>

    <li>If you are working from a computer connected to a Vive, follow the instructions near the <b>VR</b> menu
        to use this app in an interactive virtual reality mode.</li>

Built by <a href="http://www.amandaghassaei.com/" target="_blank">Amanda Ghassaei</a> as a final project for <a href="http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.849/spring17/" target="_blank">Geometric Folding Algorithms</a>.
Code available on <a href="https://github.com/amandaghassaei/OrigamiSimulator" target="_blank">Github</a>.  If you have interesting crease patterns that would
make good demo files, please send them to me (Amanda) so I can add them to the <b>Examples</b> menu.  My email address is on my website.  Thanks!<br/>

More documentation coming soon - I'm preparing a paper about the simulation methods used here, I will post it once its ready.
                    For now, find some additional info <a href="http://www.amandaghassaei.com/projects/origami_simulator/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/>
